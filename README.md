How To Run Tests
----------------

1) Install all requirements:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements
    ```

2) Download Selenium WebDriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads (choose version which is compatible with your browser)

3) Run tests:

    ```bash
    python3 -m pytest -v --driver Chrome --driver-path ~/chrome tests/*
    ```

Note:
~/chrome in this example is the file of Selenium WebDriver downloaded and unarchived on step #2.
